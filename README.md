1. Run the shortcut.

### Shortcut Configuration - LSWeather

1. Open the shortcut in Shortcuts app.
1. Set the dictionary key value `layout` to one of the predefined values `'welcome'`, `'minimalWeather'`, `'feelMotivated'`, `'minimalCalendar'`, `'showMyWork'` and `'maximalWeather'`.

   - Note: if `layout` and `apiKey` are not passed from Shortcuts app, it should be defined in the LSWeather script.
1. You can use either Photos Album or iCloud Folder to pick wallpapers for this script. To change that, look for the dictionary with `Photos` and `iCloud` boolean values and set either of them to `true`. Default is Photos.

### Script Configuration - LSWeather

1. OpenWeather API
   - Open the script in the Scriptable editor and add your openweather API key at `const WEATHER_API_KEY=`
   - Get your own API key for free [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys). Account is needed.
   - Note: Value passed from Shortcuts app will over-ride the API key value set in the script.

1. Template
   - Set `LAYOUT` to one of the predefined values `'welcome'`, `'minimalWeather'`, `'feelMotivated'`, `'minimalCalendar'`, `'showMyWork'` and `'maximalWeather'`.
   - Or use your customer layout by setting `LAYOUT = 'custom'`.
   - Note: Value passed from Shortcuts app will over-ride values set in the script.

1. Configure Weather Details
   - To show/hide weather details set `WEATHER_SHOW_WEATHER` to `true` or `false`. Hiding weather details will not call the openweather API.
   - To change weather units set `WEATHER_UNITS`. Default is `metric`.
   - To change locale/language set `WEATHER_LANG`. Default is `en`.
   - You can get valid values of `WEATHER_UNITS` & `WEATHER_LANG` [here](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api).

   - Set-up work calendars to be displayed with `CALENDAR_WORK_CALENDARS`.
     - Ex. `const CALENDAR_WORK_CALENDARS = ['Work'];`.
     - If this variable is empty (`[]`), script will not display anything. In this case also set `hide` value to 1 for the layout item `workText` (See details below).
   - Maximum personal events to show set `CALENDAR_PERSONAL_MAX_EVENTS`.
   - Maximum work events to show set `CALENDAR_WORK_MAX_EVENTS`.
   - Set-up colors for different calendars with variable `CALENDAR_COLORS`.
   - To turn on/off calendar colors set `CALENDAR_SHOW_COLORS` to `true` or `false`.

     - Ex. `const QUOTE_TAGS=['wisdom','friendship'].
     - Leave blank to get random quote across all categories.
     - You can get list of all valid tags [here](https://api.quotable.io/tags).
   - To change maximum length of quotes to be fetched set `QUOTE_MAX_LENGTH`.
   - To change quotes wrap length set `QUOTE_WRAP_LENGTH`.

   - Set above value to 0 to stop looking for updates (not recommended).

1. To show/hide last wallpaper updated time set `SHOW_LAST_UPDATED_TIME` to `true` or `false`.

1. To change the layout of the data elements update dictionary `layouts`. Checking items which you can change easily to play around with the layout.
   - [ ] source: Source of the data. Valid values are "weather", "calendar", "quote", "text" & "function".
